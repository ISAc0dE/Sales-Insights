Power BI Sales Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview

This project focuses on the sales analysis of Atliq Electronics, a brick-and-mortar electronics shop. The main objective was to create an automated dashboard using SQL and Power BI to address the challenges the business faced in scaling within a dynamically changing market and the lack of actionable insights. The dashboard tracks key sales metrics and provides a comprehensive view of the business's performance, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Goals

Develop an automated sales dashboard to provide real-time insights into business performance.
Analyze revenue growth, year-over-year (YOY) trends, and region-wise sales performance.
Identify actionable insights to help the business scale and adapt to market changes.
Facilitate quick, data-informed decision-making processes to enhance business efficiency and profitability.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Revenue Growth: Measure the increase in sales revenue over specified periods.
Year-Over-Year (YOY) Trends: Analyze the annual performance to identify growth patterns and seasonal trends.
Region-Wise Sales Performance: Evaluate sales performance across different geographical regions to identify high-performing and underperforming areas.
